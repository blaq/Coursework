				<br>Please, could you stop the noise
				<br>I'm trying to get some rest
				<br>From all the unborn chicken voices
				<br>In my head</p>
				<p>[Chorus]
				<br>What's that?
				<br>(I may be paranoid, but not an android)
				<br>What's that?
				<br>(I may be paranoid, but not an android)</p>
				<p>[Verse 2]
				<br>When I am king
				<br>You will be first against the wall
				<br>With your opinion
				<br>Which is of no consequence at all</p>
				<p>[Chorus]
				<br>What's that?
				<br>(I may be paranoid, but no android)
				<br>What's that?
				<br>(I may be paranoid, but no android)</p>
				<p>[Verse 3]
				<br>Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
				<br>Kicking, squealing, Gucci little piggy
				<br>You don't remember
				<br>You don't remember
				<br>Why don't you remember my name?
				<br>Off with his head, man
				<br>Off with his head, man
				<br>Why don't you remember my name?
				<br>I guess he does</p>

				<br>Come on, rain down on me
				<br>From a great height

				<br>Rain down, rain down
				<br>Come on, rain down on me
				<br>From a great height
				<br>From a great height, height
				<br>That's it, sir, you're leaving (Rain down)
				<br>The crackle of pigskin (Rain down)
				<br>The dust and the screaming (Come on, rain down)
